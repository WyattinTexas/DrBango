# beta3 dev tools

Two scripts, both dev-only — nothing here ships to the browser.

## make-art-assets.py

Re-cuts `beta3/art/*.png` from the original Midjourney renders — button/tile
sources in `~/Downloads`, the meadow in `~/starspell-art-sources` (override with
`MEADOW_SRC`). Run it when you want to re-tune the painted art rather than
hand-edit the PNGs. `ONLY=meadow` (or `button`/`tiles`) re-cuts one asset.

```
CALM=0.55 python3 tools/make-art-assets.py
ONLY=meadow NIGHT=0.55 python3 tools/make-art-assets.py
```

`CALM` (0–1, default 0.55) is a vertical-only blur on the tile face. It exists because
16 tiles sit on the board at once, and the painting's horizontal cloud band read as an
obviously repeated asset. 0 keeps the raw painting, 0.85 is nearly flat glass.

What the script handles that a manual crop would not:

- **Alpha is an authored rounded-rect mask, not a colour key.** The button's navy face is
  within a few RGB values of the Midjourney canvas behind it, so keying eats the face.
- **The gold rim is split from the tintable body** at a hue threshold of `r > b + 22`.
  The threshold has to clear the face itself, which is warm pink (`r - b ≈ 17`) — a lower
  threshold swallows the whole tile.
- **The rim overlay is limited to the rim and the top sheen.** The warm mid-tile cloud band
  also passes the hue test, and leaving it in the overlay makes it immune to both the tier
  colour and the calm pass.
- **The source sparkle is inpainted out**; it landed exactly on the tile's printed point
  value at +25, +21. Inpainting samples a blurred copy so the gradient continues — a flat
  fill leaves a visible patch.
- **The button's drop shadow is cropped off** on purpose. Buttons scale 1.03 on hover and
  1.08 on the launch bloom and drop to alpha 0.45 when disabled; a baked shadow grows,
  shifts and goes translucent with them.

What the meadow cut handles (`art/meadow.png`, v0.6.0):

- **The painting's sky never ships.** A per-column ridge detector keys everything above
  the mountain line to alpha 0, so the painted landscape sits against the game's own
  procedural dusk gradient — no palette clash, and the ascent/battle handoff is untouched.
- **Ridge detection needs a 20 px sustained dark run** (`lum < 148`): the pink band has
  ~10 px dark cloud streaks that an 8 px run latched onto (rectangular chunks of sky kept
  opaque), and the pale far ridge at lum ~142 vanishes if the threshold is 130. The curve
  is then median-filtered and gaussian-rounded — raw per-column disagreement renders as
  column-aligned banding, and the median alone leaves staircase plateaus on peaks.
- **`NIGHT` (0–1, default 0.55)** ramps a darken/desaturate/cool-shift grade from the
  ridge (keeps the dusk glow) to the bottom (night): the render's foreground is
  daylight-bright green, but the buttons live down there as "lanterns in dark grass".
- The matching game-side change: with the plate on, `skygrad` drops its baked razor
  horizon line and dark-ground plunge (an `artHz` variant in `ssSkyTextures`) — the
  plate's ridge sits lower than the old procedural hills in places, and the baked edge
  showed through/above the painted forest as a straight grey band.

If the art ever goes default-on (not just `?art=1`), convert the output to WebP — the
button goes 427 KB → ~55 KB with no quality loss (the meadow 639 KB → similar savings).
Palette-quantised PNG is smaller too but adds visible dither to the dark face.

## click-test.js

Verifies the game is actually **clickable**, which a screenshot cannot. Drives headless
Chrome over the DevTools protocol from node (node 22 has a global `WebSocket`, so there is
no puppeteer dependency), synthesises a real press+release on the first button, and reports
which scenes went active.

```
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --no-sandbox --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader \
  --remote-debugging-port=9333 --user-data-dir=/tmp/cdp --window-size=390,844 \
  --force-device-scale-factor=3 about:blank &

node tools/click-test.js "http://127.0.0.1:8781/index.html?art=1" click
```

Two things it will not work without:

- **`--force-device-scale-factor=3`.** At DPR 1 the canvas attribute size equals its CSS
  size, so pointer-scaling bugs are invisible. This is exactly how v0.5.0 shipped with a
  completely unclickable UI behind five clean screenshots.
- **Cache disabled** (the script sets `Network.setCacheDisabled`). The `?v=` stamps on the
  script tags will otherwise hand you the previous build, and you will "verify" the bug you
  just fixed.

Healthy output has `displayScale` equal to the device pixel ratio — if it reads `1.000` at
DPR 3, pointer coordinates are unscaled and nothing on screen is hittable.

Serve the folder over HTTP rather than opening `file://`: the painted art is drawn into
canvas textures, and a `file://` image taints the canvas so the WebGL upload throws.
