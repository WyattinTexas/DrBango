# beta3 dev tools

Three scripts, all dev-only — nothing here ships to the browser.

## make-word-packs.py

Rebuilds the per-language gameplay dictionaries `beta3/words-{es,fr,pt,de}.js`
(fed to `SS_DICT` — see packs.js for the whole language-pack system). Raw
source lists are cached in `~/starspell-art-sources/wordlist-sources/` (kept
out of the repo); the script's docstring carries sources, licenses and the
Scrabble-style normalization rules. The one subtle part: the German book
corpus contains English fragments, so German is sieved by en-vs-de relative
frequency — the measured gap (intruders ≥ 52×, true homographs ≤ 18×) is cut
at 25×. If you regenerate and "night" validates in German, that sieve broke.

## make-art-assets.py

Re-cuts `beta3/art/*.png` from the original Midjourney renders — button/tile
sources in `~/Downloads`, the meadow in `~/starspell-art-sources` (override with
`MEADOW_SRC`). Run it when you want to re-tune the painted art rather than
hand-edit the PNGs. `ONLY=meadow` (or `button`/`tiles`) re-cuts one asset.

```
CALM=0.55 python3 tools/make-art-assets.py
ONLY=meadow NIGHT=0.55 python3 tools/make-art-assets.py
```

`CALM` (0–1, default 0.55) is a vertical-only blur on the tile face. It exists because
16 tiles sit on the board at once, and the painting's horizontal cloud band read as an
obviously repeated asset. 0 keeps the raw painting, 0.85 is nearly flat glass.

What the script handles that a manual crop would not:

- **Alpha is an authored rounded-rect mask, not a colour key.** The button's navy face is
  within a few RGB values of the Midjourney canvas behind it, so keying eats the face.
- **The gold rim is split from the tintable body** at a hue threshold of `r > b + 22`.
  The threshold has to clear the face itself, which is warm pink (`r - b ≈ 17`) — a lower
  threshold swallows the whole tile.
- **The rim overlay is limited to the rim and the top sheen.** The warm mid-tile cloud band
  also passes the hue test, and leaving it in the overlay makes it immune to both the tier
  colour and the calm pass.
- **The source sparkle is inpainted out**; it landed exactly on the tile's printed point
  value at +25, +21. Inpainting samples a blurred copy so the gradient continues — a flat
  fill leaves a visible patch.
- **The button's drop shadow is cropped off** on purpose. Buttons scale 1.03 on hover and
  1.08 on the launch bloom and drop to alpha 0.45 when disabled; a baked shadow grows,
  shifts and goes translucent with them.
- **Game-side (v0.6.1):** consumers display buttons at ~3.2:1–6.5:1 while the painting is
  1.8:1, so `ssBtn()` in game.js bakes an aspect-correct 9-slice per display size —
  corners at true proportions, braid runs mirror-tiled (alternate tiles flipped so the
  pattern joins at the cuts), only the plain face stretched. Slice maths are in integer
  device pixels: fractional boundaries antialias into bright hairline seams.

What the meadow cut handles (`art/meadow.png`, v0.6.0):

- **The painting's sky never ships.** A per-column ridge detector keys everything above
  the mountain line to alpha 0, so the painted landscape sits against the game's own
  procedural dusk gradient — no palette clash, and the ascent/battle handoff is untouched.
- **Ridge detection needs a 20 px sustained dark run** (`lum < 148`): the pink band has
  ~10 px dark cloud streaks that an 8 px run latched onto (rectangular chunks of sky kept
  opaque), and the pale far ridge at lum ~142 vanishes if the threshold is 130. The curve
  is then median-filtered and gaussian-rounded — raw per-column disagreement renders as
  column-aligned banding, and the median alone leaves staircase plateaus on peaks.
- **`NIGHT` (0–1, default 0.55)** ramps a darken/desaturate/cool-shift grade from the
  ridge (keeps the dusk glow) to the bottom (night): the render's foreground is
  daylight-bright green, but the buttons live down there as "lanterns in dark grass".
- The matching game-side change: with the plate on, `skygrad` drops its baked razor
  horizon line and dark-ground plunge (an `artHz` variant in `ssSkyTextures`) — the
  plate's ridge sits lower than the old procedural hills in places, and the baked edge
  showed through/above the painted forest as a straight grey band.

If the art ever goes default-on (not just `?art=1`), convert the output to WebP — the
button goes 427 KB → ~55 KB with no quality loss (the meadow 639 KB → similar savings).
Palette-quantised PNG is smaller too but adds visible dither to the dark face.

## click-test.js

Verifies the game is actually **clickable**, which a screenshot cannot. Drives headless
Chrome over the DevTools protocol from node (node 22 has a global `WebSocket`, so there is
no puppeteer dependency), synthesises a real press+release on the first button, and reports
which scenes went active.

```
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --no-sandbox --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader \
  --remote-debugging-port=9333 --user-data-dir=/tmp/cdp --window-size=390,844 \
  --force-device-scale-factor=3 about:blank &

node tools/click-test.js "http://127.0.0.1:8781/index.html?art=1" click
```

Two things it will not work without:

- **`--force-device-scale-factor=3`.** At DPR 1 the canvas attribute size equals its CSS
  size, so pointer-scaling bugs are invisible. This is exactly how v0.5.0 shipped with a
  completely unclickable UI behind five clean screenshots.
- **Cache disabled** (the script sets `Network.setCacheDisabled`). The `?v=` stamps on the
  script tags will otherwise hand you the previous build, and you will "verify" the bug you
  just fixed.

Healthy output has `displayScale` equal to the device pixel ratio — if it reads `1.000` at
DPR 3, pointer coordinates are unscaled and nothing on screen is hittable.

If the page crawls (~5fps rAF, a renderer process pinned at 500%+ CPU), the swiftshader
GL path has gone pathological — seen with Chrome 150 (2026-08): the same scene that ran
60fps two days earlier rendered at 3-5fps, which silently stretches every scene-clock
timer ~25x and makes "the game is frozen" a false diagnosis. Swap the three GL flags for
`--disable-gpu`: Phaser falls back to its Canvas renderer, real clicks and
`--force-device-scale-factor=3` still work, and the loop runs at 60fps again.

Serve the folder over HTTP rather than opening `file://`: the painted art is drawn into
canvas textures, and a `file://` image taints the canvas so the WebGL upload throws.

## Time travel: `?daykey=` and `SSNET.setDayKey()` (v0.39.0)

The streak lantern only means anything across days, and a test cannot wait one.
Two dev-only seams in `net.js`, both aimed at `SSNET.dayKey()`:

```
http://localhost:8899/index.html?daykey=20260601     # pin today's key at boot
SSNET.setDayKey('20260602')                          # move it mid-session
SSNET.setDayKey('')                                  # back to the real clock
```

Only the **no-argument** `dayKey()` is overridden. `dayKey(someDate)` — which is
what `pruneBoards` and anything else asking about a specific date uses — always
gets the truth, so a fake today cannot make the pruner sweep live boards.

Two things to know before using it:

- **It moves the whole daily surface, not just the streak.** The board seed, the
  RTDB path (`daily/<key>`) and the played-flag all follow it, so a harness that
  plays dailies under fake keys writes real rows to future days. Those days will
  never be pruned (the sweep only deletes keys *older* than its cutoff), so
  delete them yourself: `curl -X DELETE .../starspell/daily/<key>.json`, plus the
  `players/test_*` and `weekly/<week>/test_*` rows the run leaves behind.
- **Mid-session moves are the only way to test rollover.** The meadow's daily
  chip and lantern re-check on a 1s tick; `setDayKey` then waiting ~2.6s proves
  midnight lands without a reload. Do not use a 1.6s wait — under load the scene
  clock stretches and a single tick may not have fired yet, which reads as a bug
  that isn't there.

## Harness gotchas learned on the friends/invites work (v0.25.0)

- **Never let headless Chrome reach `navigator.share`.** Headless Chrome on macOS still
  has it (127.0.0.1 is a secure context), and calling it inside a user-activation window
  opens the NATIVE macOS share sheet — the whole browser process blocks (every CDP eval
  and even `/json/list` hang) and a panel pops on Skylar's desktop. Strip it with
  `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` (`navigator.share = undefined`, and
  `navigator.clipboard = undefined` so the game falls through to `execCommand('copy')`).
  It only bites after a REAL synthesized click (transient activation lasts ~5s), which is
  why an auto-run `?frdemo=invite` boot never showed it.
- Objects inside a Container are not in `scene.children.list` — search `container.list`
  (`overlayC`, `lobbyC`, `frC`, `bannerC`).
- Click at `getBounds().centerX/Y`, not at `(x, y)`: a left-anchored text's origin sits
  exactly on its hit-area edge and the rounded pointer lands one pixel outside it.
- Subtract `cameras.main.scrollX/Y` from world coords before `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`
  — the versus lobby lives at the meadow (`zenithAtZero` sky, camera scrolled ~4200px).
- `Runtime.evaluate` with `returnByValue` on a Phaser game object comes back `undefined`,
  not truthy — always wrap finders in `!!(...)`.
- Friends recipes: `?frdemo=host&mpuid=a` (befriend test_b, wait online, CHALLENGE),
  `?frdemo=guest&mpuid=b` (auto-ACCEPT the summons), `?frdemo=invite&mpuid=a` (INVITE A
  FRIEND → private lobby), `?frdemo=join&mpuid=x` (solver on, nothing automatic — the
  real-click harness drives it). Beacons: `beta3.summons`, `beta3.deeplink`,
  `beta3.vsresult`. Clean up `friends|recent|invites|presence|players/test_*` after.
